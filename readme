get_bom_monthly_obs
===================

usage : ./GetLastMonthsObs.sh --help --? --version n m

This script collects a month's daily weather obsernations
for a given Australian BOM station.

For example, if the variable station was set to IDCJDW5003
the script will download data for Andamooka. Or you can do it
manualy
http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/IDCJDW5003.latest.shtml
under the "Other times and places" header.

For any station the BOM makes available the current month 
and the previous 13 month's data.

n is the first month, and m is the last month to collect.
Therefore n and m can be between 0 and 13 months ago.

The default is n=1, m=1; ie. only last month's data.

Depends: wget
